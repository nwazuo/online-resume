# Online Resume Project

A task from the HNGI8 internship where we're required to build an online resume website(with a contact form) that's served from a backend server.
I decided to go with a React Server-Side Rendered App served from a Node-Express server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.
