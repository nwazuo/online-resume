      `Armed with a Computer Science degree, a couple of online internships and enthusiasm to grow in this field, I look forward to working on more impactful projects that run on the web.`,
      `I beleive frameworks and languages are just tools. I also believe in using the best tools for the job, and I've been able to use these - JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, Tailwind, Less, React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Firebase etc. I remain open to learning new ones and solving exciting problems using them.
